# Data analysis

Automatic diagnosis of Chest X-Ray images through Convolutional Neural Networks. 

We aim to identify one (or more) thorax diseases from a posible 14 classes, automatically by just uploading the image. 

Developed using Tensorflow toolkit, as the final project from LeWagon's [Data-Science bootcamp](https://www.lewagon.com/data-science-course/full-time) in Buenos Aires.

Currently under development, trying new architectures to achieve best results, and deploying to GCP via Docker container. 

Dataset provided by [NIH](www.nih.gov) and downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/nih-chest-xrays/data) under COO Licence.
